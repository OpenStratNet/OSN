                  <p class="extra-spacing-bottom">"Open strategy" describes a variety of practices that promote more transparent and inclusive strategy-making. Transparency refers to openness in terms of information and communication, both internally and externally: <br>For example, Chief Executive blogs, town-halls or investor strategy updates. Inclusiveness refers to the involvement or participation in strategy-making of internal or external stakeholders from outside the usual senior management team, for example through strategy jams, wikis and workshops. Openness can be applied to both strategy-formation and strategy-implementation processes. Closely allied phenomena include ‘democratic’ strategy, crowd-sourcing and open innovation.</p>
